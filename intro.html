    <p>Levy has vanished. The one and only true force that could protect the universe from evil has disappeared, and left no clues of where he might have gone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In his abscence, the nefarious <b>IME</b> took control of the <b>GALACTIC POLI</b>, based in a pale blue planet called <b>EARTH</b>. A brave group of humans from the old <b>GALACTIC POLI</b> have estabilished a <b>RESISTANCE</b>, that after several failed attacks and many deaths, finally took control of the planet once again.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>IME</b>'s sinister leader, <b>SELLAS</b>, now prepares a counter strike, with powerful spaceships with the highest technology. The <b>RESISTANCE</b> managed to steal the plans for those spaceships, and spent all of their resources in building one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, the fate of the whole universe lies in the hands of one brave pilot, that must, all by himself, stop <b>IME</b>'s powerful attack&hellip;</p>
